# Scikit-Learn AI

This project uses machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to predict clients' credit scores based on provided data. After training and evaluation, the model predicts scores for new clients, aiding in risk assessment.

#### Included Formats:

.ipynb: Ideal for interactive analysis and exploration using Jupyter Notebook.

.py: Script version for practical execution in any Python environment.

#### Required Data Sources:

clientes.csv: Contains client data used to train and evaluate the models. 

novos_clientes.csv: Contains data for new clients to be scored by the model. 

#### Requirements to Run:

Ensure Python 3.7 or later is installed.

Install the necessary dependencies:

pip install pandas scikit-learn

For .ipynb format, install Jupyter Notebook:

pip install notebook

Make sure clientes.csv and novos_clientes.csv are in the same directory as the script or notebook.

#### Notes:

.ipynb format combines code, results, and explanations, making it more educational for learning. The .py format is simpler for automated execution and system integration.
